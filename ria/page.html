		<p>Here's a preview of one of my favorite movie series, Star wars.  Star wars is totally awsome.  I can't believe that I hated Layla before I saw Star wars because I thought that she was just a prissy, spoiled princess.  I actually liked Star wars when I saw it and couldn't stop watching the movies. I just watched Solo when it was in theaters and overall I found it to be suprisingly good, though Lucasfilms has a reputation of making good movies.  The actor playing young Han Solo was great but he was no Harrison Ford.  Rumor has it that the other movies that will be made for Star wars are stories about Yoda, Boba Fett, Jengo Fett, and Mace Windu.  There have been a lot of interesting comments lately about Star wars and there's really no telling what's true and what's fake.  Did you know that Jar Jar Binks might have been with Darth Sidious the whole time? That might sound crazy but there has been proof throught the movies. When he took over for Padme in the senate he did what she would have never done: he gave all power to Chansalor Palpatine, who was really Darth Sidious.  It may be hard to believe because of his clumsy stature. But things are not always what they seem. Anyway if you check out youtube and type in the search bar " is jar jar binks on the dark side?" a few videos will pop up with the evidence that he is bad. Stay posted for new reviews on my website. </p>

	<p>Harry Potter is also one of my favorite movie series.  The movies just get better and better as you go along.  Not to mention the books. It's just so wonderful to be able to be taken into the mystical world where witches and wizards are real.  Have you ever heard Jim Dale read them on audio?  He is so good at imitating the voices of each and every characters in the book exactly how you imagine them.  How cool is that!  I rate all the Harry Potter movies 5* out of 5* for kids above age 7.  Of course, if you are a very ambitious kid willing to see soul sucking monsters and a ton of blood, feel free to ask your parents first before realizing how scary it is and not being able to sleep for nights on end.  The movies never scared me of course because I have seen other scary movies like Gremlins.  Ever seen the preview of the movie Venom? I'm telling you, that movie will scare you out of your wits.  But I am not going to tell you about it because some of you might want to see it. Let's get back to the previews. At the very beggining of the first movie I thought I would go to sleep because it was soooo BORING!!!! In truth it was actually exciting and suspenseful. When I saw Voldemort living as a parasite on the back of Quirell's head, I was suprised. I thought that he would be a bit larger and taller. Overall, all the movies are great. Did you know that the Harry Potter series is one of the last that isn't owned by Disney? If you are a Harry Potter fan, then stay posted for the Harry Potter secrets that are coming soon to my website! (make sure to check out the video game I made below)</p>
